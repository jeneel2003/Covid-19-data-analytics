COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project is part of a comprehensive data science series, where we explore various datasets using Python. In this particular project, we analyze a mini dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective is to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus through data exploration and analysis.

Project Overview
Dataset: COVID-19 cases data (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered) by region.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
matplotlib: For plotting graphs.
Key Tasks and Solutions
Show the number of Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered cases in each Region.
Remove records where the Confirmed Cases are less than 10.
Identify the region with the maximum number of Confirmed cases.
Identify the region with the minimum number of Deaths.
Analyze the COVID-19 situation in India up to April 29, 2020.
Sort data based on Confirmed and Recovered cases in ascending and descending order, respectively.
Commands and Techniques
Data Loading: pd.read_csv to import the CSV file.
Handling Missing Values: df.isnull().sum() and sns.heatmap() to detect and visualize missing data.
Grouping Data: df.groupby('Col_name') to analyze data by specific columns.
Sorting Data: df.sort_values(by=['Col_name']) to order the data based on specific columns.
Filtering Data: df[df.Col_1 == 'Element1'] to filter rows based on conditions.
